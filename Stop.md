# Stop

Stop!\
Because the time won’t stop for you\
And before you realise\
It would have passed\
And Neither hard work nor money\
Will be able to bring it back\
I can tell you\
Because I know it\
It was winter of 2017\
I was living in Montreal\
When my cousin’s friend told me\
My grandma was no more\
I cried\
For what I had lost\
My grandmas had died\
And I hadn’t seen her since last year\
She used to tell me bedtime stories\
I didn’t even say her bye\
For all the hard work\
All the money\
And I couldn’t get a moment\
To spend with my grandma\
Because I didn’t stop\
When there was time\
Now the time had passed\
And she passed with it
