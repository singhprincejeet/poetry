# I want to sing

I just wanna sing\
Because the words give me a ring\
Why can't I be offbeat\
Why I gotta follow the musical sheet?

Because when I see her\
I remember no lyric. I remember no tune.\
I just remember,\
that I am the ocean and she is the moon

I just wanna sing\
To tell her how much I love her\
That she is my need\
And to do that, I need no musical sheet

I lover her to moon and back\
And if there is farther than that\
I love her to my bone\
I love her, its set on stone

Don't get me wrong\
I just wanna sing a song\
For her\
Because to her I do belong

I just wanna tell her. how I feel?\
When she is with me and when she is not\
Every time every moment\
She is in my every thought

If just words could have said it\
I would have said it before\
Just words can't do justice\
To my love-lore
