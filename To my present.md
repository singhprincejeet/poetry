# To my present

Don’t worry about the past\
It’s called past for a reason\
Because it has passed\
And it can’t be changed

Don’t worry about the future\
Because it’s yet to come\
And even hours of worrying\
Will not reveal, what’s going to happen?

Make best use of your present\
Because this is what you control\
And how you use it\
Is what defines you
