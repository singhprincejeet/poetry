# Happy International Day of Women

I owe a lot in my life to many people. My family, friends, relatives and mentors have helped me a lot to be where I am. Many of those who helped me were woman. Two of those ladies had a major impact on the path that my life is right now.

Founder of my high school(Sacred Heart School, Moga) helped me by giving me admission to her school. I remember when she interviewed me. I didn't speak english back then and education in her school was provided in english medium. She gave me a chance to study in her school and that helped me a lot in my career. If it wasn't for her I would not have been able to learn all the things I learned.

My first boss was a woman. I remember when I was looking for my first internship. It was my first year in Canada and I was so scared that I will be jobless. She hired me when I needed it the most. Working under her, I learned a lot. I am very thankful to her for giving me my first job. I am able to be where I am because I was able to start when she gave me the opportunity.

Not just these two ladies but al my female relatives, friends and mentors have helped me to get where I am. I don't think I have to tell anybody how much of my life's progress is dedicated to just my mom. I am very lucky to have all these amazing women in life. Today, when we celebrate their day. I wish them a happy international day of women and an amazing year ahead.
