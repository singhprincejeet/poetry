# Regret

Do I not have regrets in my life\
Does the ghost of past not haunt me\
Yes, it does\
And I remember all my mistakes\
I remember not working hard enough in high school\
I remember not being understanding enough of her\
I remember my anger take best of me\
I remember letting other make use of me\
But will regretting change anything?\
No, it will not\
So, let the past be in past\
And make things better from now\
I will work hard in Uni to make my dad proud\
When I will meet someone new, I will try to understand them\
I will not do something under emotions, which I will later regret\
I will love myself, so no one can make use of me\
I know I can do it\
Because I control my present\
I will not worry about past\
Because what is done is done
