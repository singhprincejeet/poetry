# Namaste

I am too busy in my work\
I have no time for my haters\
I wanna shine in the sky\
I wanna appear in theatres\
For those who don’t like me\
Can sit on the side\
Because I am going to win\
By a landslide\
Those who don’t care about me\
I don’t care about them no more\
I say them namaste\
And close my door

I am going ahead in life\
I don’t live in past\
I have plans for future\
And time is moving fast\
The ghosts of what has happened\
Can’t scare me of my future\
Because I ain’t making old mistakes\
As my wrongs are my tutor\
The things of past\
Don’t affect my snore\
I say them namaste\
And close my door
