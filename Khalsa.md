# Khalsa

My name is Prince\
My color is brown\
I wear my turban\
As a crown\
I grow my hair\
As symbol of my faith\
It taught me to love\
And not to hate

Four centuries ago\
In a hilly town\
To fight against\
An unjust crown\
A Lion roared\
and woke up a clan\
That was the birth\
of the Khalis man

A khalsa is sworn\
To fight for the weak\
To be cut into pieces\
But never leave\
Khalsa believe in love\
And it promotes equality\
It preaches peace\
And fights brutality

This poem is dedicated\
To my beloved Panth\
To the believers of truth\
To the readers of Granth\
The history of Khalsa\
Always makes me proud\
It gave me an identity\
To separate me from crowd
