# Smile

Smile!\
Because there is food on your plate\
And if there ain't\
Then remember\
If tiny ants can find food\
Then so can you

Smile!\
Because you can go around the world\
And if you think you can't\
Then remember\
If birds can fly from north pole to south pole\
Then so can you\

Smile!\
Because you can see your surroundings\
And if you think you can't\
Then remember\
If bats can see through ears\
Then so can you

Smile!\
Because everything will be alright\
And if you think it won't\
Then remember\
Even after the longest night, the sun does shine\
And so will you

Smile!\
Because you have been blessed\
And if you think you haven't\
Then remember\
To read this poem again\
And you will know
